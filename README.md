### Number converter application
This is a standard number converter application, the difference is that the conversions are written in the backend with c++ and the frontend is built in React.js

How the backend and the frontend are connected is `(NodeJs addon using the V8)` and then calling the functions in Node.

The application makes use of an Express.js server in the backend.
